# Neutrino Oscillation computation

This project is designed to compute the flavor oscillation of neutrinos in four distinct cases:
1. **Two flavor approximation using classical methods**
2. **Two flavor approximation using quantum computation**
3. **Three flavor case using classical methods**
4. **Three flavor case using quantum computation**

## Description
The Neutrino Flavor Oscillation Calculator is a tool that allows users to study the oscillation behavior of neutrinos. This phenomenon, where neutrinos switch between different flavors (electron, muon, and tau), is computed under four scenarios. Each scenario provides a unique method of calculation, whether classical or quantum computational techniques.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neutrino-flavor-oscillation.git
    cd neutrino-flavor-oscillation
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Before using the code, it is highly recommended to read the top text explaining what each code segment does and the bottom part explaining how to access each specific code.

**Important**: In order to use the code, you will need to modify the parameters manually in each Python file. Detailed instructions on how to adjust these parameters are provided at the bottom of each file.
